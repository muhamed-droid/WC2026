I picked up one interesting application to work on. It is named WC2026. 
World cup 2026 is a simulation of the world cup 2026. 
User can start simulation, pick teams to participate in the world cup. 
User needs to place teams in groups, respecting certain restrictions. 
Then, system forms football matches. 
User have an option to see tables, to enter results. 
After the group games are finished, there are teams advancing into next round called knokout stage. 
System generates matches for knokout stage. 
User enter results of football matches with the regulations of winner stays. 
There are 5 rounds in knokout stage: round of 32, round of 16, quarter finals, semi finals and final(3rd place playoff also being played for bronze medal). 
After all rounds there is only one winner.
